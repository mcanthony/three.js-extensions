This set of controls performs orbiting, dollying (zooming), and panning. It maintains the "up" direction as +Y, unlike the TrackballControls. Touch on tablet and phones is supported.

Orbit - left mouse / touch: one finger move
Zoom - middle mouse, or mousewheel / touch: two finger spread or squish
Pan - right mouse, or arrow keys / touch: three finter swipe
